                    I have worked at LSEG from October 2022 to April 2023 as a trainee software engineer. I
                    was exposed to java core, OOP concepts and data structures as a trainee. I
                    was assigned to develop an exchange system using java core and socket programming.
                    Further I could be able to participate some KT's regarding the architecture and the
                    frameworks used by the LSEG.
