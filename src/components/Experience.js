            <p className={""}>
                I have worked at LSEG from October 2022 to April 2023 as a trainee software engineer. I
                was exposed to java core, OOP concepts and data structures as a trainee. I
                was assigned to develop an exchange system using java core and socket programming.
                Further I could be able to participate some KT's regarding the architecture and the
                frameworks used by the LSEG.
